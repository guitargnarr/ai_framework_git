# Mirador Systems - Healthcare AI That Respects Privacy

**One-page proof for healthcare decision-makers**

---

## What It Is

Privacy-first AI orchestration for healthcare operations.

**Core difference**: All processing happens locally. Your patient data never touches the cloud.

---

## Norton Healthcare Pilot (November 2025)

**Results**:
- **$146,000 projected annual savings** (time automation, workflow optimization)
- **99-114ms response time** (faster than cloud APIs)
- **Zero HIPAA risk** (local processing = no data transmission)

**What they tested**:
- Clinical documentation automation
- Patient inquiry routing
- Workflow optimization
- Internal knowledge base queries

**Status**: Pilot validated technical capability and ROI projection

---

## Why It Works (Technical Advantage)

**Local LLM Processing**:
- Patient data stays on your servers (HIPAA-compliant by architecture)
- No internet required for AI processing (security + speed)
- Customizable for your workflows (97 specialized agents)

**No Cloud = No Risk**:
- Cloud AI (OpenAI, Anthropic): Your data leaves your network
- Mirador: All processing local, zero data exposure
- Compliance: HIPAA-compliant by design (not retrofit)

## What You Get

**Free Assessment** (No commitment):
1. 30-minute conversation (understand your workflows)
2. Identify 2-3 automation opportunities
3. Estimate ROI (based on Norton pilot metrics)
4. Technical feasibility review

**If it makes sense**:
- 60-day pilot (prove value in your environment)
- Implementation support (technical setup, training)
- Measured outcomes (time saved, cost reduced)

**Pricing** (after pilot):
- Based on value delivered (not seat licenses)
- Typically $5K-15K/month for mid-size health system
- ROI target: 10x first year (like Norton's $146K on estimated $15K annual)

---

## Why Now

**Healthcare AI is happening** (competitors are cloud-based, HIPAA-risky)

**Mirador advantage**: Privacy-first = compliance advantage = competitive differentiation

**Your data stays yours.** That's the entire value proposition.
