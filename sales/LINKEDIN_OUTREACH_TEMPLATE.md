```
Hi [NAME] - saw [HOSPITAL] is modernizing IT. We ran a pilot at Norton Healthcare ($146K savings, local AI = HIPAA compliant). Worth a conversation?
```

## Full Message (If already connected)

**Subject**: Norton Healthcare AI pilot - relevant to [HOSPITAL]?

**Body**:

```
Hi [NAME],

Quick question: Is [HOSPITAL] exploring AI for clinical documentation or workflow automation?

We just completed a pilot at Norton Healthcare:
- $146,000 projected annual savings
- 99ms response time (local processing, not cloud)
- HIPAA-compliant by architecture (data never leaves your servers)

If you're looking at AI but concerned about patient privacy/compliance, this might be relevant.

No sales pitch - just offering a free 30-min assessment to see if the approach fits [HOSPITAL]'s needs.

Worth a conversation?

Best,
Matthew Scott

1. Ask: "Can I follow up in 3 months?"
2. Note in tracker: Follow-up date
3. Send update when you have more pilots/case studies

**If no response**:
1. Wait 7 days
2. One follow-up: "Just checking if this landed - no pressure either way"
3. If still no response after 14 days: Mark as "Not interested" and move on

**Realistic**: 30% response rate (3/10), 10% convert to call (1/10)

**Good outcome**: 1 free assessment scheduled (proves messaging works)

**Great outcome**: 1 pilot interest (validates product-market fit)
