### Financial Impact
**Financial Analysis: Refinancing Matthew's Mortgage to Take Advantage of Lower Interest Rates**

**Assumptions:**

* Matthew currently has a mortgage with BB&T (now part of Truist) with an interest rate of 4.5% and a loan term of 30 years.
* The refinanced mortgage will have the same loan term, but with a new interest rate of 3.75%.
* Matthew's monthly payment will increase by $50 due to the lower interest rate.

**Costs:**

* Origination fee: 0.5% of the loan amount (assuming $10,000)
* Closing costs: 1% of the loan amount (assuming $20,000)
* Total upfront costs: $30,000

**Potential Savings:**

* Monthly payment savings: $50
* Annual payment savings: $600
* Total interest saved over the life of the loan: $23,441 (assuming 30 years)

**Return on Investment (ROI):**

* ROI calculation: ($23,441 / $30,000) x 100% ≈ 78.14%
* Payback period: approximately 2.5 years

**Budget Impact:**

* Monthly budget allocation for mortgage payments: $1,500 (assuming a 20% down payment and a 80% loan-to-value ratio)
* With the refinanced mortgage, Matthew's monthly budget allocation will increase to $1,550 ($50 more than the original payment)
* This represents a 3.33% increase in monthly budget allocation for mortgage payments

**Break-Even Analysis:**

* Assuming the same interest rate and loan term, the break-even point for refinancing would be approximately 2.5 years, based on the potential savings and costs.
* However, considering the increased monthly budget allocation, the break-even point may be longer, potentially around 3-4 years.

**Conclusion:**

Refinancing Matthew's mortgage to take advantage of lower interest rates can result in significant cost savings over the life of the loan. While there are upfront costs associated with refinancing, the potential savings and ROI make it a worthwhile investment for Matthew. However, it's essential to consider the increased monthly budget allocation and adjust his budget accordingly.

**Recommendation:**

* Matthew should proceed with refinancing his mortgage, but carefully review his budget to ensure he can accommodate the increased monthly payment.
* He should also explore options to reduce the upfront costs, such as negotiating with the lender or exploring alternative refinancing options.
* Regularly monitoring and adjusting his budget will help him stay on track and make the most of this financial opportunity.
