# LinkedIn Profile - Online Trust Foundation

**Purpose**: When prospects Google you, LinkedIn appears first. Make it build trust.

---

## Headline (First Impression - 220 char limit)

**Current** (likely): Job title, skills list
**Should be**: Outcomes + Authority + Location

**Template**:
```
AI-Native Systems Builder | Healthcare AI: Norton pilot, $146K savings | Louisville KY | Fair Shake Methodology
```

**Why**:
- "AI-Native Systems Builder" = unique positioning (not "developer" or "engineer")
- "Norton pilot, $146K savings" = proof (not claims)
- "Louisville KY" = local authority
- "Fair Shake Methodology" = differentiation (process matters)

## About Section (Story, Not Resume)

**Structure** (2000 char limit):

**Paragraph 1: Who I Am (Values)**
```
I believe in technical honesty and transparent process.

When small AI models couldn't do arithmetic reliably, I didn't hide it - I built hybrid systems (Python for math, AI for qualitative). When repos got archived hastily, I learned to give everything a fair shake before deciding.

This approach - transparent, thorough, data-driven - defines how I work.
```

**Paragraph 2: What I Do (Outcomes)**
```
I build AI systems with real-world validation:

- Healthcare AI: Norton Healthcare pilot (November 2025) - $146,000 projected annual savings through local processing (HIPAA-compliant by architecture)
- Personal tools with traction: 81 jobs tracked, 14.3% response rate (beats industry 5-8% baseline)
- Technical depth: 7-model ML ensembles, 18 live deployments, 26 GitHub repos

Not claims. Measurable outcomes.
```

**Paragraph 3: How I Work (Process)**
```
Rapid execution: Full-stack products in 30 minutes (proven 4 times).
Fair investigation: Every project gets thorough assessment (learned from Archive-Recovery incident).
Privacy-first: All databases local (HIPAA compliance, zero cloud risk).

Infrastructure serves outcomes, not the other way around.
```

**Paragraph 4: Why Louisville (Local Authority)**
```
Based in Louisville, KY. Working with local healthcare systems (Norton Healthcare), building tools that respect privacy and prove value with data.

If you need AI systems that work (not hype), let's talk.
```

## Experience Section (Frame as Outcomes)

**NOT**: "Software Engineer at Company X (dates)"
**YES**: "Founder, Mirador Systems (outcomes)"

**Template**:
```

## Skills (Searchable Keywords)

**Add these** (LinkedIn SEO):
- Healthcare AI
- HIPAA Compliance
- Privacy-First Architecture
- AI-Native Development
- Local LLM Processing
- FastAPI
- Machine Learning Ensemble Methods
- Rapid Deployment
- Louisville Healthcare Technology

---

## Recommendations (Social Proof)

**If possible**, request from:
- Norton Healthcare contact (if relationship allows)
- Anyone who's seen your work
- Fellow developers who've reviewed your GitHub

**Template request**:
> "Would you be willing to write a brief LinkedIn recommendation about [specific outcome/project]? No pressure - only if you're comfortable."

## The Test (Does This Build Trust?)

**Someone Googles**: "Matthew Scott Louisville AI"
**LinkedIn appears**: Top result
**They read**: About section (transparent process, real outcomes, local focus)
**They check**: Featured (live demos, GitHub repos, case studies)
**They think**: "This person has proof, not just claims. Worth a conversation."

**THEN**: Outreach template works (they're warm, not cold)

---

## Time Investment

**LinkedIn optimization**: 1-2 hours (one-time, high ROI)
**Maintaining**: 15 min/month (update with new outcomes)

**This is the trust foundation** that makes all other outreach effective.
