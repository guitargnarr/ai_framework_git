## Article 1: "Why Privacy-First Wins in Healthcare AI"

**Hook**: Norton Healthcare saved $146K with an approach most vendors won't offer
**Thesis**: Local processing isn't technical debt - it's competitive advantage
**Proof**: HIPAA compliance, zero cloud risk, faster response times
**Length**: 1000 words
**SEO**: "Healthcare AI", "HIPAA compliance", "privacy-first AI"

**Outline**:
1. The Problem: Cloud AI exposes patient data (compliance risk)
2. The Standard Approach: "We're HIPAA-compliant" (after the fact, not by design)
3. The Alternative: Local processing (compliant by architecture)
4. Norton Pilot: $146K savings, 99ms response, zero data exposure
5. Why This Matters: Privacy = competitive advantage (not limitation)

**CTA**: "If you're exploring healthcare AI but worried about compliance, let's talk."

## Article 2: "Small AI Models Can't Do Math (And What I Did About It)"

**Hook**: I built a deployment assessment tool. It scored everything 85/100. That's when I learned.
**Thesis**: Hybrid AI+Python > Pure AI (use each for what they're good at)
**Proof**: Test case (perfect repo: 90, terrible repo: 90 → broken)
**Length**: 800 words
**SEO**: "AI limitations", "hybrid AI", "AI+Python", "honest AI development"

**Outline**:
1. The Failure: Oracle scored all repos identically (AI can't count)
2. The Discovery: Small models pattern-match, don't reason
3. The Fix: Python does math, AI does qualitative
4. The Lesson: Use AI where it excels, not everywhere
5. Why This Matters: Technical honesty > AI hype

**CTA**: "Working with AI? Let's be honest about what works and what doesn't."

## Article 3: "Fair Shake: Lessons from Archive-Recovery"

**Hook**: I lost projects by archiving too quickly. Had to recover them. Learned my lesson.
**Thesis**: Thorough investigation prevents costly mistakes
**Proof**: Archive-Recovery 2025-11-18 incident, fair shake framework result
**Length**: 600 words
**SEO**: "project management", "decision-making", "technical leadership"

**Outline**:
1. The Mistake: Quick judgments ("looks incomplete, archive it")
2. The Cost: Time recovering what shouldn't have been lost
3. The Framework: Fair shake (investigate → test → decide)
4. The Results: Found 3 capabilities with validation (would've missed otherwise)
5. Why This Matters: Thoroughness pays off (rush creates waste)

**CTA**: "Building systems? Don't rush critical decisions."

## Article 4: "30-Minute Full-Stack: How I Deploy That Fast"

**Hook**: PhishGuard (backend + frontend) deployed in 30 minutes. Here's how.
**Thesis**: Methodologies enable speed without sacrificing quality
**Proof**: 4 deployments (PhishGuard, jaspermatters, FretForge, llm-demo)
**Length**: 1200 words
**SEO**: "rapid deployment", "DevOps", "AI-assisted development"

**Outline**:
1. The Pattern: Railway (15 min) + Elite Frontend (5 min) + Vercel (5 min) + QA (5 min)
2. The Tools: Hybrid scoring (Oracle), code generation (85% AI + 15% human)
3. The Results: 4/4 success rate, all production-quality
4. The Limitations: B+ code needs fixes (Icon imports, API fields)
5. Why This Matters: Speed + quality (not choose one)

**CTA**: "Need to ship fast? Let's talk about what's actually possible."

## Publishing Strategy

**Order** (build credibility progressively):
1. Start with #2 (Technical honesty) - establishes differentiation
2. Then #4 (Rapid deployment) - shows capability
3. Then #1 (Healthcare AI) - targets market
4. Then #3 (Fair Shake) - shows process maturity

**Frequency**: 1 article every 2 weeks (sustained, not one-off)

**Distribution**:
- LinkedIn native article (max reach in target audience)
- Cross-post to Medium (SEO, broader audience)
- Share on Dev.to (developer community)

**Engagement**:
- Respond to all comments (build relationships)
- Share others' content (not just promote own)
- Join conversations (healthcare AI, DevOps, Louisville tech)

## SEO Impact (The Trust Test)

**After 4 articles published**:

Google: "Matthew Scott Louisville AI"
**Should find**:
1. LinkedIn profile (optimized, Norton mention)
2. LinkedIn articles (4 published, thought leadership)
3. Medium profile (cross-posted content)
4. GitHub (26 repos, active)

**Result**: Established authority (not random stranger)

**Then**: Outreach templates work (warm, not cold)

---

**These articles build trust BEFORE outreach happens.**

**Write → Publish → Wait 2-4 weeks → Then outreach** (when online presence exists).
