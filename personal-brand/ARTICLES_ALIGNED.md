## Article 1: "40 Projects in 3 Months: What I Learned Leaving Humana"

**Hook**: I left my job and built everything I could think of. Some worked. Most didn't. Here's the honest account.

**Outline**:
1. **The Setup**: Left Humana (August 2025), 10 years → uncertainty
2. **The Build**: 40 projects in 3 months (email security, job tools, healthcare AI, guitar apps, experiments)
3. **The Mistakes**:
   - Archived too quickly (Archive-Recovery incident)
   - Built tools to find products (already had validation)
   - Documentation explosion (4,500 lines, purged 82%)
4. **The Breakthroughs**:
   - Fair shake prevents regrets (thorough investigation)
   - Found validation I almost missed (pilot data, traction metrics)
   - 18 live deployments (proved I can ship)
5. **The Honest State**: Capability proven, revenue $0, building online trust now
6. **What I'd Tell Someone Starting**: Audit first, build second, validate throughout

**Length**: 1500 words
**Audience**: Anyone facing career transition, building in public

## Article 2: "I Tried to Make AI Do Math. It Couldn't. Here's What I Built Instead."

**Hook**: Built a deployment tool. It scored every project 85/100. That's when I realized small AI models can't count.

**Outline**:
1. **The Problem**: Need to assess 40 projects for deployment readiness
2. **The AI Solution**: Built Oracle with small AI model (llama3.2:1b)
3. **The Failure**: Scored perfect repo 90, terrible repo 90 (identical)
4. **The Discovery**: Small models pattern-match, don't do arithmetic
5. **The Fix**: Hybrid (Python does math, AI does qualitative)
6. **The Learning**: Use AI where it excels (code generation), Python where it's better (scoring, logic)
7. **The Tools I Built**: Deployment Oracle (hybrid), Elite Frontend (B+ code generator)
8. **Why This Matters**: Honesty about AI limitations (not hype)

**Length**: 1200 words
**Audience**: Developers working with AI, technical decision-makers
**SEO**: "AI limitations", "hybrid AI", "Claude Code development"

## Article 3: "30-Minute Full-Stack: How I Deployed PhishGuard (With Claude Code)"

**Hook**: Backend API + Frontend demo deployed in 30 minutes. Not a tutorial. A journey through what worked.

**Outline**:
1. **The Challenge**: PhishGuard API exists (Railway), needs user-facing demo
2. **The Tools**: Elite Frontend (generates 85% correct Next.js code), deployment patterns
3. **The Process**:
   - Generate component (3 min, AI)
   - Fix imports (2 min, human - Icon → Check, Mail, Shield)
   - Create Next.js project (5 min)
   - Deploy to Vercel (5 min)
   - Connect to GitHub (2 min)
   - **Total**: 17 minutes actual (30 with verification)
4. **The Mistakes**: Elite Frontend hallucinated metrics ($10M instead of $146K), Auth protection (Vercel defaults)
5. **The Results**: 4/4 success (PhishGuard, jaspermatters, FretForge, llm-demo prep)
6. **Why It Works**: AI scaffolds, human QAs (85/15 split)
7. **The Honest Part**: This is with AI assistance (Claude Code), not manual coding

**Length**: 1400 words
**Audience**: Developers, technical builders, AI-curious
**SEO**: "Claude Code", "AI-assisted development", "rapid deployment"

## Article 4: "What 40 Projects Taught Me About 'Fair Shake'"

**Hook**: I lost projects by archiving hastily. Recovered them weeks later. Built a framework to never repeat that mistake.

**Outline**:
1. **The Incident**: Archive-Recovery 2025-11-18 (lost repos, had to get them back)
2. **The Pain**: Time wasted recovering what shouldn't have been archived
3. **The Learning**: Every project deserves investigation (not quick dismissal)
4. **The Framework**: Fair Shake (15-30 min investigation → data-driven decision → archive only after proof of no value)
5. **The Results**: Found capabilities with validation (would've archived them with quick scan)
6. **The Tools**: Deployment Oracle for initial filter, human for value assessment
7. **Why This Matters**: Career transitions are messy - thoroughness prevents regrets

**Length**: 1000 words

## Publishing Voice (Aligned)

**NOT**: "Here's how to do X" (authority)
**YES**: "Here's what happened when I tried X" (journey)

**NOT**: "Best practices for Y"
**YES**: "I did Y, it failed/worked, here's why"

**NOT**: "10 years of experience shows..."
**YES**: "3 months in, here's what I've learned so far"

**Honesty**: This is early (3 months), learning (mistakes included), building (not built)

## The Sequence (Corrected)

**Article 1**: "40 Projects in 3 Months" (sets context - journey, not authority)
**Article 2**: "AI Can't Do Math" (technical honesty, differentiation)
**Article 3**: "30-Min Full-Stack" (capability proof, AI-assisted transparency)
**Article 4**: "Fair Shake Framework" (process maturity from mistakes)

**Publishing**: 1 every 2 weeks (sustained presence)
**Platform**: LinkedIn Articles (primary), cross-post Medium/Dev.to

## What This Communicates (The Brand)

**Not**: "Hire me, I'm an expert"
**Actually**: "I'm 3 months into building after leaving my job. Here's what I've learned. Here's what works. Still figuring it out, but making real progress."

**Trust through**: Honesty about journey, transparency about AI assistance, real data from struggle

**This resonates with**: Anyone who's been through transition, anyone building with AI, anyone tired of fake authority

**All articles now align with THE_REAL_STORY** (journey, not authority).

**Voice**: Learning in public, transparent about AI tools, honest about state.
