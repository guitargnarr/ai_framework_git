# LinkedIn Profile - Aligned with Real Journey

**Positioning**: 3 months post-career, building in public, transparent process
**NOT**: Established authority (fake it)
**ACTUALLY**: Journey in progress (share it)

## Headline (Honest Journey)

```
Building in Public: 3 Months Post-Humana | 40 Projects → 18 Live Deployments | AI-Native Development | Louisville
```

**What this says**:
- Transparent about timeline (3 months, not 10 years)
- Shows output (40 projects → 18 deployed = execution)
- Honest positioning (building, not built)
- Local (Louisville presence)

## About Section (The Real Story)

**Paragraph 1: Where I Am (Honesty)**
```
3 months ago I left Humana (10 years, stable path).

Since then: Built 40 projects. Deployed 18. Learned what works and what doesn't.

This is that journey - transparent, messy, real. Not a success story (yet). A building-in-public story.
```

**Paragraph 2: What I Built (With AI, Honestly)**
```
Working with Claude Code, I've built:

Tools:
- Deployment Oracle: Assesses repos in 2.3 seconds (hybrid Python+AI after discovering small models can't do math)
- Elite Frontend Engineer: Generates 85% correct code (I QA the other 15%)

Projects:
- PhishGuard: 7-model ML ensemble for email security (100% test accuracy, 18 live demos)
- Job automation: Tracked 81 applications, 14.3% response rate (beat 5-8% baseline using my own tool)
- Healthcare AI exploration: Tested locally (HIPAA-compliant architecture, pilot interest)

Real outcomes. Real data. Built with AI assistance (not hiding that).
```

**Paragraph 3: What I Learned (Lessons from Struggle)**
```
Mistakes made:
- Archived projects too quickly (had to recover them - learned "fair shake" investigation)
- Tried pure AI scoring (failed - learned hybrid Python+AI approach)
- Built 4,500 lines of docs (bloat - learned modular > monolithic)

Breakthroughs:
- Full-stack product in 30 minutes (PhishGuard API+UI, proven 4 times)
- Systematic vetting (40 repos assessed, found validation I almost missed)
- Transparent process (show limitations, not hide them)

This is AI-native development: Orchestrating AI to build, learning in public, honest about what works.
```

**Paragraph 4: What's Next (Honest State)**
```
Current state: Capability proven (18 deployments), revenue TBD (no paying customers yet).

Building online trust through:
- Publishing what I learn (articles on hybrid AI, rapid deployment, fair shake methodology)
- Sharing real data (not claims - actual metrics, test results, live demos)
- Transparent process (show the struggle, not just the wins)

Louisville-based. Building tools that work. Learning in public.

If this resonates, let's talk.

## Experience (Journey Framing)

```
AI-Native Development (Independent)
August 2025 - Present (3 months)

Building with AI assistance (Claude Code):
- 40 projects created and assessed
- 18 live deployments (Vercel, Railway, Render, Netlify)
- 26 GitHub repos (TensorFlow, FastAPI, Next.js, React)
- Tools: Deployment Oracle, Elite Frontend Engineer

Methodology proven:
- Rapid deployment: 30-minute full-stack (backend + frontend)
- Fair shake vetting: Systematic investigation prevents archive mistakes
- Hybrid AI+Python: Use each for what they're good at
- Transparent process: Show what works AND what doesn't

Outcomes:
- PhishGuard: 7-model ML ensemble, email security
- Job automation: 81 apps tracked, 14.3% response (personal use)
- Healthcare AI: Pilot testing, privacy-first architecture

Learning in public. Building with transparency. No revenue yet, proving capability.

## The Message (What This Communicates)

**To prospects**: "I'm building, learning, sharing transparently. Early (3 months), but proven capability (18 deployments)."

**To peers**: "Went through career transition, built 40 projects, learned what works. Here's the honest account."

**To future employers**: "Can build rapidly (30 min full-stack), works with AI tools, transparent about limitations."

**Differentiation**: Most hide the struggle. I'm showing it. That builds trust with people who've been there.
