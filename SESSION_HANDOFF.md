### 1. Mirador Systems (ACTIVE CUSTOMER)

### 2. job-search-automation (REAL TRACTION)

## 👉 NEXT ACTION (80% Focus)

**Scale Mirador Systems** (Norton success → more customers):

```bash
# 1. Create sales collateral
- Norton case study (ROI calculator, quotes, metrics)
- HIPAA compliance brief
- Mirador Systems deck

# 2. Identify prospects
- 3-5 Louisville healthcare systems
- Similar to Norton (mid-size, modernizing IT)

# 3. Outreach
