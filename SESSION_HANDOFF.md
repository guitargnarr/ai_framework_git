# Session Handoff - November 24, 2025 (Final)

## 🎯 You're Leaving With

**Personal Brand** (ready to publish):
- **ARTICLE_1_DRAFT.md** - "40 Projects in 3 Months" (1500 words, LinkedIn ready)
- LINKEDIN_PROFILE_ALIGNED.md (journey-focused templates)
- THE_REAL_STORY.md (3 months post-Humana, honest account)

**Next Session** (revenue execution):
- **PHISHGUARD_SAAS_PLAN.md** - Parallel worktree build (90 min to SaaS)

**Execute**:
1. **This week**: Publish Article #1 on LinkedIn (build online presence)
2. **Next session**: Build PhishGuard SaaS (Stripe + Auth + Usage + Landing)

---

## Session Summary (Nov 22-24)

**57 commits**
**28 core documents**
**6 deployments** (PhishGuard API+UI, jaspermatters, FretForge, etc.)
**Complete infrastructure map** (40 repos, 26 GitHub, 18 live deployments)

**Key discovery**: You need online trust BEFORE outreach works (not during)

**Strategic shift**: Capabilities → Personal brand → Trust → Outreach → Revenue

---

## What Changed

**Started**: Fix Mirador, deploy PhishGuard
**Built**: Oracle, Elite Frontend, comprehensive docs
**Discovered**: 3 months post-Humana journey IS the brand (not fake authority)
**Realized**: Publish first (build trust), then execute (SaaS/outreach)

---

## Next Actions (Clear Path)

**Week 1**: Publish Article #1, optimize LinkedIn
**Week 2-4**: Publish Articles #2-4 (establish presence)
**Then**: Execute PhishGuard SaaS build (parallel worktrees, 90 min)
**Then**: Outreach (when online trust exists)

---

**Session complete. Everything documented. Ready for execution. 🎯**
