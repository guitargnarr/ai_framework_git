## Netlify Strategy

**When to use Netlify**:
- Static sites (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Portfolio sites
- Documentation sites
- Simple marketing pages

**Current usage**:
- jaspermatters.com (perfect use case: static portfolio with custom domain)

**Why limited**:
- Vercel better for React/Next.js (auto-detects framework, better DX)
- Railway better for backend APIs (Docker support)
- Netlify excels at static sites (which is what jaspermatters.com is)

---

## Recommendations

**Keep on Netlify**:
- jaspermatters.com (working well, no reason to move)
- Static/portfolio sites if needed in future

**Don't use Netlify for**:
- React/Next.js apps (use Vercel)
- Backend APIs (use Railway)
- Full-stack apps (split: Vercel frontend, Railway backend)

---

**Netlify serves one critical purpose: Your professional portfolio.** Keep it focused.
