# Repository Vetting Results - Fair Shake Assessment

**Started**: Nov 23, 2025
**Framework**: PRODUCT_VETTING_FRAMEWORK.md (systematic, not hasty)
**Principle**: Every repo deserves investigation before archive

---

## Vetting Status

**Completed**: 11 repos
**Remaining**: 29 repos
**Method**: Deep investigation → Market validation → Data-driven decision

---

## BATCH 1: Fully Vetted (Decisions Made)

### ✅ TIER 1: Commercial Products (6 deployed)

**1. PhishGuard** (Full-Stack)
- **Investigation**: Email security, ML-based phishing detection
- **Market**: Real problem, 87% accuracy verified
- **Decision**: ✅ PURSUE (add pricing, monetize)
- **Next**: Stripe integration, $5/month test

**2. jaspermatters-job-intelligence**
- **Investigation**: ML portfolio showcase, production-ready
- **Market**: Demonstrates TensorFlow/scikit-learn expertise
- **Decision**: ✅ KEEP (consulting lead generator)

**3. FretForge**
- **Investigation**: Guitar learning, accessibility-focused, PWA
- **Market**: 285M visually impaired users mentioned
- **Decision**: ✅ KEEP (portfolio + potential freemium)

**4-6**: guitar.projectlavos, prompt-showcase (already live, keeping)

---

### ⚠️ TIER 3: Investigated, Personal/Low Commercial Value

**7. OurJourney/personal-journey-flow**
- **Investigation**: Couples wellness, custody scheduling, Airflow automation
- **Market**: Personal tool, niche (couples tracking)
- **Decision**: ✅ KEEP (personal use, not commercial focus)
- **Reasoning**: Valuable for personal use, low revenue potential

**8. reflexia-model-manager**
- **Investigation**: Ollama orchestration layer, adaptive quantization, RAG
- **Market**: Niche (Ollama users wanting more features)
- **Decision**: ⚠️ TBD (needs market test - would anyone use this?)

### 🔍 TIER 4: Under Investigation (Fair Shake In Progress)

**9. consciousness-experiments**
- **What it is**: AI consciousness detection research (6 Python scripts)
- **Purpose**: Academic exploration, not product
- **Files**: detector, orchestrator, visualization, tests
- **Commercial value**: None (theoretical research)
- **Consulting value**: LOW (not practical ML work)
- **Preliminary decision**: Archive (after documenting learnings)
- **Fair shake complete**: ✅

**10. knowledge-base**
- **Status**: Placeholder README, needs investigation
- **Fair shake**: PENDING (don't dismiss without checking files)

**11. ollama-experiments**
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Fair shake**: PENDING

## Fair Shake Commitment

**We will NOT archive any repo without**:
1. ✅ Deep investigation (understand what it does)
2. ✅ Completeness check (does it work?)
3. ✅ Market consideration (who would use it?)
4. ✅ Consulting value (demonstrates capability?)

**Only after all 4**: Consider archive (and document why)

**This prevents**: Archive-Recovery incidents (losing repos, having to get them back)

---

## Next Actions

**Short-term** (this/next session):
- Complete fair shake for remaining 29 repos
- Apply vetting framework systematically
- Document decisions with reasoning

**Medium-term** (after all vetting):
- Archive confirmed low-value repos (with documentation)
- Focus commercial efforts on Tier 1
- Deploy Tier 2 candidates

**Long-term** (ongoing):
- Market test PhishGuard (pricing)
- Package AI DevOps Toolkit
- Generate first revenue

---

**Vetting is systematic, not rushed. Every repo gets its investigation.**
